Starting learning design patterns by reading book [Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-oriented Softerware](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1471276307&sr=8-1&keywords=design+patterns). I think I have been seeing the design patterns a lot in my daily life and use them from time to time, like factory, iterator, but I never site down and go through all of them in an organized way. 

I will put what I've learned here and today is the overview tables of all the patterns in the book.

There is a collection of good examples in Python, which could be founded here: [python-patterns](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns)

| Purpose    | Design Pattern          | Scope        | Aspects That Can Vary                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Creational | Abstract Factory        | Object       | families of product objects              |
|            | Builder                 | Object       | how a composite objects gets created     |
|            | Factory Method          | Class        | subclass of objects that is instantiated |
|            | Prototype               | Object       | class of object that is instantiated     |
|            | Singleton               | Object       | the solo instance of a object            |
| Structural | Adapter                 | Class/Object | interface to an object                   |
|            | Bridge                  | Object       | implementation of an object              |
|            | Composite               | Object       | structure and composition of an object   |
|            | Decorator               | Object       | responsibilities of an object without subclassing |
|            | Facade                  | Object       | interface to a subsystem                 |
|            | Flyweight               | Object       | storage costs of objects                 |
|            | Proxy                   | Object       | how an object is accessed; its location  |
| Behavioral | Chain of Responsibility | Object       | object that can fulfill an request       |
|            | Command                 | Object       | when and how a request is fulfilled      |
|            | Interpreter             | Class        | grammar and interpretation of a language |
|            | Iterator                | Object       | how an aggregate's elements are accessed, traversed |
|            | Mediator                | Object       | how and which objects interact with each other |
|            | Memento                 | Object       | what private information is stored outside an object, and when |
|            | Observer                | Object       | number of objects that depend on another objects; how the dependent objects stay up to date |
|            | State                   | Object       | states of an object                      |
|            | Strategy                | Object       | an algorithm                             |
|            | Template Method         | Class        | steps of an algorithm                    |
|            | Visitor                 | Object       | operations that can be applied to objects without changing their classes |
